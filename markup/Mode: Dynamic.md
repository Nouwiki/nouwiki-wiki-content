# Mode: Dynamic

Dynamic mode is pretty much as statically served single page application, you access the wiki through a index.html file and it parses the available content for viewing, no need to build anything except the index.html _once_ (and every time you change or update the template or a new nouwiki version comes out, but _not_ on adding new content or plugins).
